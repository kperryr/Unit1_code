	INSTRUCTIONS

	Your birthday is coming up, and you have a few relatives
	who always give you cash (including one uncle who is as
	rich as Croesus but doesn't always remember your birthday). 

	You're not sure how much total cash you'll get yet, but
	you're already thinking about how you'll spend it!
		- If you get at least $75, you will buy a nice new laptop 
		  bag for study sessions with your classmates at local 
		  libraries and coffeeshops. Very practical.
		- If you get at least $125, you're going to buy a decent
		  27" monitor instead for your desk at home. What an
		  improvement that will be!
	    - If Uncle George comes through, you're likely to get 
		  a lot more than that and can afford both! Whatever 
		  amount you have leftover (beyond $200) will go in 
		  savings for now.
	    - If you get less than $75, you'll get some decent
		  earbuds so at least you can vibe to your music in both
		  ears again. 

	Ultimately you will write and test two functions:

	1. Create a utility function that accepts an array of numbers 
	   and returns the sum of all the elements.

	2. Your primary function should accept an array of numbers 
	   representing the amounts received from various relatives. 
	   Make use of the first function to get a total, then print 
	   one or more statements describing the outcome of your
	   birthday spending spree.

	Pseudocode your logic first, then write actual code.

	You should test the first function before moving on to the
	second.

	Here is some sample data for testing:

	[25, 20]
	[50, 25, 75]
	[80, 50, 25, 20]
	[25, 50, 60, 20, 500]

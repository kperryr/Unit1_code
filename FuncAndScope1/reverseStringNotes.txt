What is your reverseString() returning? State data type, and any other important details

	--reverseString is returning a string. However, it will return 
	substrings of the argument pass into it, until it is completely reversed.


What operations is your function executing? explain logic in words- 

	rubber ducky method:

	My function reverseString will check if the base case is met. The smallest substring of any string is
	a char. So I will check if the length of the string is 1 or less.
	Next, I will extract the last character of the string and assign it to a new variable.
	Next, I will extract the remaining characters of the string and assign them to a new variable.
	In order to reverse the string, I will combine the last character of each substring that is extracted 
	when I call reverseString and assign that to a new string.
	Finally I will return that string.


	PseudoCode:

	Declare reverseString with one parameter (str)
		Check if str.length <=1
			return str if true
		extract last char of str and assign to variable
		extract all chars except last char and assign to variable
		concat last char and reverseString(rest of chars) and assign to new variable
		return new string 


	What built-in methods are you using?

		I can use .indexOf() to get the last character
		I can use .slice() to get the last character or to remove the last character from the string


What does the call stack look like when executing reverseString? 
	EX "hello"
	1.call reverseString(hello)
		- push first instance of reverseString to stack

	2.call reverseString(hell)
		- push second instance of reverseString to stack

	3.call reverseString(hel)
		- push third instance of reverseString to stack

	4.call reverseString(he)
		- push fourth instance of reverseString to stack

	5.call reverseString(h)
		-- push fifth instance of reverseString to stack
		return h
		-- pop fifth instance of reverseString off stack

	go back to fourth call of reverseString
		return eh
		- pop fourth instance of reverseString off stack

	go back to third call of reverseString
		return leh
		- pop third instance of reverseString off stack

	go back to second call of reverseString
		return lleh
		- pop fourth instance of reverseString off stack

	go back to first call of reverseString
		return olleh
		- pop fifth instance of reverseString off stack

What small operations are being repeated? 
   --Operations being repeated?
 	I am taking the last char of each substring and 
	adding it the beginning of a new string repeatedly

What values are being returned at each step, or is there a value being returned at each step in the call stack? 
Think back to our discussion yesterday. Return finishes execution of a function and removes it off the stack. 
So will each step have a value being returned? 
	--No, since this is recursion a function will be called until the base condition is met. Once the base 
		condition is met, values will begin to be returned.
